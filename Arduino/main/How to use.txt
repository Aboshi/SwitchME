Step 1: Run `binConverter.py hekate.bin` inside of `Arduino/main` to get `Arduino/main/hekate.h`

Step 2: Open Arduino/main/main.ino with Arduino

Step 3(Make sure board steps have been completed in the main readme.md):
Sketch > Export Compiled Binary. Save to `Arduino/main`. This will create a new .bin file.

Step 4: Run `uf2Conv.py Arduino/main/nameOfBinFile.bin -o path/to/NEW.uf2` to convert exported bin to UF2.
OPTIONALLY: If your switch is in HOS mode and the modchip is in bootloader mode, and connected to your PC already, you can run: 
`uf2Conv.py Arduino/main/nameOfBinFile.bin` to flash to the chip directly.

Step 5: Rename to `NEW.uf2

Step 6: Plug Switch into PC USB. 

Step 7: Boot into Nintendo OS (HOS). 

Step 8: Double tap modchip button. 

Step 9: Drag new `NEW.UF2` onto Modchip Drive.

Profit!
